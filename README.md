# AtliQ Hotels Business Intelligence Dashboard

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hotels, a chain of 5‚≠ê hotels across India, has been a key player in the hospitality domain for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective management decisions, the company is losing market share and revenue. To regain their competitive edge, the director decided to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" for data-driven decision-making. Since AtliQ Hotels does not have an in-house Data Analytics team, they hired a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights.
